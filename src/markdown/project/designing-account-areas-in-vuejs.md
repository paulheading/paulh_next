# Designing Account Areas in Vue.js

### What's the Project?

Update the [Barbican ticketing platform](https://tickets.barbican.org.uk) with a modular design that better reflects the brand and offers a wider range of functionality.

### Can I see it?

Sure, it's at [tickets.barbican.org.uk](https://tickets.barbican.org.uk)

The code is in a private [Barbican](https://barbican.org.uk) [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) repository sadly.

I have started writing about [this project](https://blog.paulh.biz/designing-account-areas-in-vuejs) on [my blog](https://blog.paulh.biz).

### How much did you do?

Most things on the frontend, which includes:

- üíª Building the app in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org)
- üé® Designing the user journey with [Figma](https://figma.com)
- üìù Writing the [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com)

### What are the interesting parts?

The platform is built in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and combines [Drupal](https://drupal.org) data from the [main website](https://barbican.org.uk) with ticketing data from [Spektrix](https://spektrix.com). It's been at the centre of user-focussed innovation at the [Barbican](https://barbican.org.uk) for the last 3 years.

### What needs improving?

- **Documentation** üò• It really should include [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app) and [SassDoc](https://sassdoc.com). The code is well structured but will be tricky to maintain without notes.

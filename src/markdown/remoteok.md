Hey 👋 I'm Paul, a Front-end Designer and Developer.

I've been a Developer since 2020 and a Designer for over 10 years. I work in the Digital Products team at the Barbican and spend my time building/designing better website-based experiences.

I love building things, solving problems 🤓 and making a difference. I've always been creative, but it wasn't until I found graphic design that I understood how to use that skill. For me, web development is a continuation of that journey.

I joined the Barbican as a Designer in 2013, and moved into digital design, creating trailers for the in-house cinemas and animating HTML5 adverts.

My portfolio is made from a combination of NextJS and a few external APIs. I use Trello to organise my case studies and pull some playlists from Spotify.

I'm currently building an events management app in Vue 3 for the Barbican and recently finished building https://sparkthecannon.com (also NextJS).

Please take a look at my resume page https://paulh.biz/resume for more examples.

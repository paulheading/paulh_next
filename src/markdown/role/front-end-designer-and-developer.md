# Front-end Designer and Developer

### What's the Role?

[Front-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development) Designer and Developer working for the [Barbican](https://barbican.org.uk) in London. I create [wireframes](https://www.figma.com/blog/how-to-wireframe/) and [prototypes](https://www.uiprep.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-prototyping-in-figma) in [Figma](https://figma.com), and build things in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org).

### What does this include?

- ⏱️ Working as part of an Agile environment and estimating deadlines within a fortnightly workflow
- 🗣️ Presenting at fortnightly demos to staff across the organisation
- 🗣️ Beta testing and responding to user feedback
- 👨‍🔬 Designing more inclusive and accessible online experiences
- 🎨 Designing wireframes and prototypes with Figma
- 💻 Building functionality with Vue.js
- 🚀 Animating user interactions with GSAP
- 📝 Styling layouts and translating designs with SCSS

<!-- ### What are the interesting parts?

This website creates content by combining data from multiple APIs. It scrapes and stores data during local development, rather than on deploy, so is super fast and consistent at build time.

It also makes use of [Next.js dynamic routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes), [markdown for content generation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raw-loader) and [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap) for web animation.

### What needs improving?

- **Documentation** 😥 It really should include [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app) and [SassDoc](https://sassdoc.com). The code is well structured but will be tricky to maintain without notes. -->

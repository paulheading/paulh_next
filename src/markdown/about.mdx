# About

Hey 👋 I'm Paul, a Front-end Designer and Developer.

I've been a Developer since 2020 and a Designer for over 10 years. I work in the **Digital Products** team at the [Barbican](https://barbican.org.uk) and spend my time building/designing better website-based experiences.

Before 2020, I worked as a [Designer](https://www.creativelivesinprogress.com/article/paul-heading) 👨‍🎨 in the [Barbican Design Studio](https://www.creativelivesinprogress.com/article/barbican).

### Why I do this

I love building things, solving problems 🤓 and making a difference. I've always been creative, but it wasn't until I found graphic design that I understood how to use that skill. For me, web development is the next step in that journey.

Both design and development are about communicating ideas effectively, removing obstacles and bringing joy where possible. I especially love doing this for people and causes I care about.

I started out working in print design (at [Skye Creative](http://www.skyecreative.co.uk/) and [Brandwave](https://brandwavemarketing.com/)) before joining the [Barbican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbican_Centre) as a Junior Designer in 2013. I moved further into digital design, creating trailers for the in-house cinemas and animating HTML5 adverts.

During those years, I also mentored a young designer ([Ernest Wereko](https://www.ernestwereko.com/)) and built the website/brand for [36 Bourne Street](https://36bournestreet.com). This marked the beginning of my journey into professional web development, and I began studying the [Full Stack Javascript Techdegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/plans) at [TeamTreehouse.com](https://teamtreehouse.com).

### What I've built

I built this site! It's made in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) using [functional components](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-function-component/) and a few [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) (mainly [Trello](https://trello.com) and [Spotify](https://spotify.com)). I use Trello to organise case my studies and pull cool tunes from [Spotify](https://spotify.com).

I'm currently building an [events management app](https://paulh.biz/project/organising-spaces-with-graphql) (in [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/)) for the Barbican and recently finished building [sparkthecannon.com](https://sparkthecannon.com) (also in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)).

Take a look at my [resume page](https://paulh.biz/resume) for more examples.

Hey 👋 I'm Paul, a Front End Developer and Designer.

I've been a Developer since 2020 and a Designer for over 10 years. I work in the Digital Products team at the Barbican (https://barbican.org.uk) and spend my time building/drawing better website-based experiences.

Before 2020, I worked as a Designer (https://www.creativelivesinprogress.com/article/paul-heading) 👨‍🎨 in the Barbican Design Team (https://www.creativelivesinprogress.com/article/barbican).

I love building things, solving problems 🤓 and making a difference. I've always been creative, but it wasn't until I found graphic design that I understood how to use that skill. For me, web development is a continuation of that journey.

Both design and development are about communicating ideas effectively, removing obstacles and bringing joy where possible.

I joined the Barbican as a Designer in 2013, and moved further into digital design, creating trailers for the in-house cinemas and animating HTML5 adverts.

During those years, I also mentored a young designer (https://www.ernestwereko.com) and built the website/brand for 36 Bourne Street (https://36bournestreet.com). This marked the beginning of my journey into professional web development, and I began studying the Full Stack Javascript Techdegree (https://teamtreehouse.com/plans).

My portfolio is made with Next.js (https://nextjs.org) and a few APIs (mainly https://trello.com and https://spotify.com). I use Trello to organise my case studies and pull cool tunes from Spotify.

I'm currently building an events management app (https://blog.paulh.biz/organising-spaces-with-graphql-1) in Vue 3 for the Barbican and recently finished building https://sparkthecannon.com (which is also in Next.js).

Take a look at my resume page (https://paulh.biz/resume) for more examples.

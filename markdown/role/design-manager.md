# Design Manager

### What's the Role?

I worked in the [Barbican Design Studio](https://www.creativelivesinprogress.com/article/barbican), designing digital content for marketing campaigns, as well as managing one other Designer.

### What does this include?

- 🎞️ Creating cinema trailers with Adobe After Effects
- 🚀 Animating HTML 5 advertising with GSAP
- 🎨 Designing layouts and concepts with Sketch
- 👨‍💻 Managing workflow with Trello

<!-- ### What are the interesting parts?

This website creates content by combining data from multiple APIs. It scrapes and stores data during local development, rather than on deploy, so is super fast and consistent at build time.

It also makes use of [Next.js dynamic routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes), [markdown for content generation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raw-loader) and [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap) for web animation.

### What needs improving?

- **Documentation** 😥 It really should include [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app) and [SassDoc](https://sassdoc.com). The code is well structured but will be tricky to maintain without notes. -->

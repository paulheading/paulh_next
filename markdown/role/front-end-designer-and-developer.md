# Front-end Designer and Developer

### What's the Role?

[Front-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development) Designer and Developer working for the [Barbican](https://barbican.org.uk) in London. I create [wireframes](https://www.figma.com/blog/how-to-wireframe/) and [prototypes](https://www.uiprep.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-prototyping-in-figma) in [Figma](https://figma.com), and build things in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). Outside of this role, I also like to build in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)

### How much did you do?

Everything! Which includes:

- 💻 Building the app in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- 🎨 Designing the layout with [Figma](https://figma.com)
- 🚀 Animating the brand artwork in [GSAP](https://greensock.com)
- 📝 Writing the [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com)

### What are the interesting parts?

This website creates content by combining data from multiple APIs. It scrapes and stores data during local development, rather than on deploy, so is super fast and consistent at build time.

It also makes use of [Next.js dynamic routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes), [markdown for content generation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raw-loader) and [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap) for web animation.

### What needs improving?

- **Documentation** 😥 It really should include [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app) and [SassDoc](https://sassdoc.com). The code is well structured but will be tricky to maintain without notes.

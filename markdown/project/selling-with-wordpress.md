# Selling designer fabric with Wordpress

### What's the Project?

Build and brand [36 Bourne Street](https://36bournestreet.com). An online store, built in [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com) for a leather and fabric retailer off the [Pimlico Road, London](https://www.sothebys.com/en/digital-catalogues/the-pimlico-road-londons-design-antiques-district).

### Can I see it?

Sure, it's at [36bournestreet.com](https://www.36bournestreet.com)

The code is in my public [Github](https://github.com) [repository](https://github.com/paulheading/BourneSt).

### How much did you do?

Pretty much everything, which includes:

- 💻 Building a child theme for [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/)
- 🎨 Designing the layouts with [Figma](https://figma.com)
- 🚀 Animating the brand artwork in [GSAP](https://greensock.com)
- 📝 Writing the [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com)

### What are the interesting parts?

The handdrawn artwork was pretty interesting to work on and adapt for the website. This was also my first time coding for a [CMS](https://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/content-management-system-cms), using [template partials in Wordpress](https://www.sitepoint.com/build-wordpress-theme-from-scratch-first-steps) and building functionality with the [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com) plugin.

### What needs improving?

- **Documentation** 😥 It really should include [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app) and [SassDoc](https://sassdoc.com). The code is well structured but will be tricky to maintain without notes.
